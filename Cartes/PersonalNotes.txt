I will write here some personal notes of the main difficulties at the begining of my learning of React and GitHub.

- I was not able to commit and push to the repository on GitHub because I was not logged in to the right account on my computer.
    I solved the issue by logging into the right account : Windows Control Panel -> Credentials Manager -> GitHub

- I used the command npm create vite@latest to initialize the react project

- I run the command npm run dev but it was not working because I did not runned the command npm install in the directory

- I learned about .gitignore

- I understood that the server and client sides work separatly
    In dev I need a proxy port to enable interaction between client and server.
